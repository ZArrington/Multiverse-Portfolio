## Acknowledgements

I'd like to extend an appreciate to Multiverse for the wealth of resources and teachings they have provided for us. The knowledge and skills I gained over the year have been transformative.

I would also like to express my gratitude for Verizon for entrusting me with an incredible opportunity. 

Lastly, I want to express my thanks to my Multiverse coach, Laurie Corrin, for her support and incredible attitude throughout the journey. Laurie's guidance has been such a big help and I am confident that it will help me beyond the apprenticeship.
