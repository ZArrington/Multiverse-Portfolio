## Employee Management App Reflection
This is an Angular project, collaboratively built for the Multiverse bootcamp. As part of our assignment, we were given the freedom to work on a personal project of our liking. We chose to work on an Employee Management App because we thought it would similar to what we would be working on in our apprenticeship.

We picked up a course that provided step-by-step guidance on creating the front-end and back-end as well as building out the data for the app. During this project I was exposed to Angular for the first time and expanded my skillset. Additionally, this project played a significant role in strenghtening my teamwork skills. We effectively communicated with and supported each other throughout the project. (JF 6.1|JF 6.6)

We ran into some bugs along the way but we were able to overcome it through a lot of ' console.logs',colloboration and increased productivity. In the end we were able to create a working full-stack Angular application.
