## Employee Management App Reflection
This is an Angular project, collaboratively built for the Multiverse bootcamp. As part of our assignment, we were given the freedom to work on a personal project of our liking. We chose to work on an Employee Management App because we thought it would similar to what we would be working on in our apprenticeship.

We picked up a course that provided step-by-step guidance on creating the front-end and back-end as well as building out the data for the app. During this project I was exposed to Angular for the first time and expanded my skillset. Additionally, this project played a significant role in strenghtening my teamwork skills. We effectively communicated with and supported each other throughout the project. (JF 6.1|JF 6.6)

We ran into some bugs along the way but we were able to overcome it through a lot of ' console.logs',colloboration and increased productivity. In the end we were able to create a working full-stack Angular application.

## Competencies
### JF 6.1
- Knows how best to communicate using different communication methods and how to adapt appropriately to different audiences

Since we were working in a group it was crucial to communicate our progress throughout the project. My team member and I communicated through Slack, text message and video meetings when it came to collaborating, sending updates and asking questions. Whenever there was an issue we used our communication channels to walk through the problem. My partner and I had similar communication styles and this made the process a lot smoother. Working on this project was a pleasant experience and I enjoyed working as part of a team to complete it. 

### JF 6.7
- Communicates effectively in a variety of situations to both a technical and nontechnical audience.

We were tasked with presenting our application and sharing our project experience with both our peers and coaches. Since not everyone was working with the same technologies, we needed to effectively convey the purpose and functionality of our app. During the presentation, we provided a clear explanation of our application. We talked about its features and its purpose and ensured that the audience had a clear understanding of the work we accomplished.
