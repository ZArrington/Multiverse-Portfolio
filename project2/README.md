## UI Enhancement Reflection

During my apprenticeship, I was put on a pair programming project and we were tasked with working on two enhancements to the internal user interface for my team. I was part of a team of 3 that worked on the full-stack web development. Initially, a senior team member gave us small scavenger hunt tasks to familiarize ourselves with the code then we were tasked with working on a JIRA ticket and adding two read-only features on the website.

The project was a unique challenge for me as I had no prior experience with C#, SQL, .NET or Angular. However, with the collaborating and guidance from my team members I gained newfound confidence in navigating these technologies and making edits. 

I actively contributed to the development process by creating four new components and two containers to house those components. I also worked on the back-end API and database intergration. I helped create new routes for the API and connected them to the front-end(JF 2.5|JF 3.4). Through these tasks, I gained hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end development.

In the end, we were able to complete two fully functional features to the website and improved user experience.(JF 3.3)

## Technologies
- Angular, HTML, CSS
- .NET, C#
- SQL

## Competencies
### JF 3.3
- JF 3.3 Can link code to data sets
I tasked myself with establishing the connection between the API routes and the front-end to create functionality. To begin, I utilized Visual Studio and leveraged .NET to create the API route instructions. Once the API routes were established I transitioned into the front-end. From here, I connected the routes and appropriate end=points in the Angular code. By completing this step, I ensured that the website could effectively communicate with the back-end.
