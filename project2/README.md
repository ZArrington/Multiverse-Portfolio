## UI Enhancement Reflection

During my apprenticeship, I was put on a pair programming project, and we were tasked with working on two enhancements to the internal user interface for my team. I was part of a team of 3 that worked on full-stack web development. Initially, a senior team member gave us small scavenger hunt tasks to familiarize ourselves with the code then we were tasked with working on a JIRA ticket and adding two read-only features on the website.

The project was a unique challenge for me as I had no prior experience with C#, SQL, .NET or Angular. However, with the collaboration and guidance from my team members, I gained newfound confidence in navigating these technologies and making edits. 

I actively contributed to the development process by creating four new components and two containers to house those components. I also worked on the back-end API and database integration. I helped create new routes for the API and connected them to the front end (JF 2.5|JF 3.4). Through these tasks, I gained hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end development.

In the end, we were able to complete two fully functional features of the website and improved user experience. (JF 3.3)

## Technologies
- Angular, HTML, CSS
- .NET, C#
- SQL

## Competencies
### JF 3.3
- JF 3.3 Can link code to data sets

I tasked myself with establishing the connection between the API routes and the front end to create functionality. To begin, I utilized Visual Studio and leveraged .NET to create the API route instructions. Once the API routes were established, I transitioned into the front end. From here, I connected the routes and appropriate endpoints in the Angular code. By completing this step, I ensured that the website could effectively communicate with the back end.

### JF 2.5
- Can implement a responsive User Interface

Creating a user interface was not a simple task and involved multiple components, which includes the front-end, back-end, and databases. On the front end, we focused on designing and implementing the visual elements for the overall user experience. This includes using HTML, CSS, and utilizing the Angular framework.  On the back-end, we developed the logic and functionality that powered the user interface. This involved setting up Apis and creating routes. For managing data, we looked over the SQL database to see which tables had the necessary data needed to use for our APIs.

Bringing these pieces together required careful coordination and collaboration between the team. Overall, I learned a lot from the process and really enjoyed working on this part of the project!
